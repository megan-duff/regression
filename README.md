# regression

In this project I investigated Denverâ€™s current traffic problem by trying to identify any relationships between Denver neighborhoods 
with longer commute times and Denver neighborhood characteristics, such as percentage of education levels, 
rent prices, home value, poverty, race, age, income, and sex. The paper attached explains my regression analysis and provides relevant 
explanations for decisions made through out the process.
